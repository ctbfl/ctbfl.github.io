## Research Interests

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2025 Fall admission. If you have any information, please contact me!</font>**

My ultimate goal is to build **home service robots** that can serve people and enhance their quality of life.

The kitchen, as a microcosm of the broader domestic environment, serves as an ideal starting point
for this endeavor.

Specifically, the operations within the kitchen can be categorized into three primary tasks.

- **Ingredient Preparation:** Transforming raw materials into ready-to-cook components.
- **Food Production:**  Assisting in or executing the cooking process.
- **Post-Meal Processing:** Handling tasks such as dishwashing, cleaning, and waste disposal, maintaining kitchen hygiene and usability

Under this context, my research interest lies in **computer vision**, **robot manipulation**, **long-term planning**, **multi-modal understanding**, etc. Any aspect that would help with these tasks will interest me.
