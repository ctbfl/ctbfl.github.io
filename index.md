# About Me

<img src="https://junshanhuang.com/images/Interesting_image_HJS_square.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Junshan Huang (é»„ä¿Šå–„)**.<br>

I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Information Science at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I am also an incoming CS Ph.D. student at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/). I will join the [Algorithmic Robotics & Control Lab](https://arc-l.github.io/) under the supervision of Prof. Jingjin Yu. At Rutgers, I will continue my research on dexterous manipulation with an application focus on kitchen scenarios.

I also spent a wonderful time at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in the LONG Group, working with [Prof. Long Chen](https://zjuchenlong.github.io/).

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at: huangjunshan [at] mail.ustc.edu.cn.

## Research Interests

My ultimate goal is to build low cost **home service robots** that can serve people and enhance their quality of life.

The kitchen, as a microcosm of the broader domestic environment, serves as an ideal starting point
for this endeavor.

Specifically, the operations within the kitchen can be categorized into three primary tasks.

- **Ingredient Preparation:** Transforming raw materials into ready-to-cook components.
- **Food Production:**  Assisting in or executing the cooking process.
- **Post-Meal Processing:** Handling tasks such as dishwashing, cleaning, and waste disposal, maintaining kitchen hygiene and usability

Under this context, any aspect that would help with these tasks will interest me, like **computer vision**, **robot manipulation**, **long-term planning**, **multi-modal understanding**, etc.
