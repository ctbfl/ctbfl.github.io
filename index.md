## Research Interests

My ultimate goal and dream is to build low cost **home service robots** that can serve people and enhance their quality of life.

The kitchen, as a microcosm of the broader domestic environment, serves as an ideal starting point
for this endeavor.

Specifically, the operations within the kitchen can be categorized into three primary tasks.

- **Ingredient Preparation:** Transforming raw materials into ready-to-cook components.
- **Food Production:**  Assisting in or executing the cooking process.
- **Post-Meal Processing:** Handling tasks such as dishwashing, cleaning, and waste disposal, maintaining kitchen hygiene and usability

Under this context, any aspect that would help with these tasks will interest me, like **computer vision**, **robot manipulation**, **long-term planning**, **multi-modal understanding**, etc.
